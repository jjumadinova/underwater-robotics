                    The current methods for water quality testing either use a
                    single sensor to get a random sample for testing each water
                    quality	parameter separately, or data buoys that are able to
                    obtain readings from multiple sensors at a stationary location.

                    \emph{This project presents:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item A single unit comprised of \textbf{multiple sensors}
                        that are able to collect data simultaneously for water
                        quality testing.
                        \item This multi-sensor unit attachable to the \textbf{underwater robot}
                        to collect data at various depths of the water column for
                        an extended period of time.
                        \item \textbf{Data collection} and \textbf{data analysis}
                        software to manage the data and assess certain trends in
                        the water quality over time.

 Lake Erie algal blooms are an annual threat to the health
                       of \textbf{more than 11 million people}. Toxins produced
                       by harmful algal blooms  deeply affected the economy of the coastal towns
                       and the health of the environment and the public.

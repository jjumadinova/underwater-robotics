                    The current methods for water quality testing either use  a single
                    sensor to get a random sample for testing each water quality 											parameter separately, or data buoys that are able to obtain
                    readings from multiple sensors at a stationary location.
                    \vspace{3mm}

                    \emph{This project presents:}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item A single unit comprised of \textbf{multiple sensors} that are able to collect data simultaneously for water quality testing.
                        \item This multi-sensor unit attachable to the \textbf{underwater robot} to collect data at various depths of the water column for an extended period of time.
                        \item \textbf{Data collection} and \textbf{data analysis} software to manage the data and assess certain trends in the water quality over time.
                    \end{itemize}

                       Lake Erie algal blooms are an annual threat to the health of \textbf{more than 11 million people}. Toxins produced by harmful algal blooms have deeply affected the economy and health of the environment and the public. Coastal towns that rely on tourism are negatively affected by toxic algal blooms.

                \begin{itemize}
               		\item Drinking water is polluted.
					\item Local residents and visitors are prevented from boating, swimming, and visiting Lake Erie shorelines.
					\item Nearby residents are vulnerable to illnesses caused by the toxins.
					\item Toxins can result in the death of marine life, and severely impact an aquatic ecosystem.
